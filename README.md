## üí≠ Reflection

The project was created over 7 weeks and is my final Project Exam at Noroff. The goal of the project was to use the knowledge of technologies learned during the past two years and create a social media app. The concept is you can either share a thought/quote or an image that inspires you. I wanted to make a mindful social media where the content is curated and not overwhelming. 

The app is built with `create-react-app` and `react-router-dom 6.4`. Bootstrap and Sass is used for styling, following BEM syntax. I have done my best in following DRY principle and making sensible folder and component names. With the bootstrap framework and some extra media queries the app is fully responsive and is suitable for mobiles, ipads and desktop. 

`Yup` is used for form validation. I am importing fonts from Google Fonts and icons from Ionicons. Timestamps are handled using `react-time-ago` component and pagination is handled using `react-infinite-scroll` component. SEO are handled with `react-helmet-async` component. 

React useState and useEffect with `Axios` are used for handling requests and doing access control. For example the settings button for updating profile information is only available on your own profile, as well as the edit and delete of posts.

I had challenges during the project. One of them was finding a good folder structure as the project grew, and also finding suitable component names. I think I had a good start but then eventually it became more and more fluffy as projects often do. I have split as logically as possible into reusable components. 

It was difficult to figure out how to update content automatically with the api. I chose to use window.location.reload() as a quick solution. I know there is better ways using render and or push to state in React. But this was all new territory for me, so I chose to focus on implementing all necessary functionality and getting the overall experience good. 

I struggled a lot with errors due to the api, especially with too many re-renders.
